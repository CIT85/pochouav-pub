<h1>Hello, I'm Pochoua Vang.</h1>

<hr>

<p>Why am I taking this course?</p>

<ol>
    <li>I've always love coding and building stuff when it comes to the web.</li>
    <li>I believe by completing this course will refresh my memory of coding as I didn't get to work on much
        projects as I would like to due to outside work and family.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>What do I think about using ChatGPT for researching my topic?</p>

<ol>
    <li>Using ChatGPT when it comes to researching for topics is a good thing due to not wasting so much time searching for a topic.</li>
    <li>Sometimes it's not that great using it when it comes to trying to solve a complex problem.</li>
</ol>
